          <p>Our goal with this project is to create a highly-optimised set
            of XPages mobile controls with:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>close-to-native performance</li>
            <li>attractive aesthetics and</li>
            <li>compatible with the Teamstudio Unplugged mobile
              offline XPages engine running on iOS and Android devices.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible for (reasonably
            experienced) XPage developers to create attractive Unplugged mobile
            apps. Unplugged Controls can be styled to match a customer's
            preferred branding using the new Unplugged Re-Styler.
          </p>
          <p>We're also providing several app templates (Teamroom, Doc Library,
            Journal, Contacts, Activities, Media, Approvals) built from the
            controls to give you a faster start with your development projects.
            These controls target both tablet and smartphone users, for iOS
            (iOS 6.0 and higher) and Android devices (Android 4.0 and higher).
            We also publish periodic updates of to these controls to&nbsp;<a href="#">OpenNTF</a>.

          <p>These controls are primarily designed to work with the Unplugged
            platform from Teamstudio. However they have been extended and
            tested to work on Webkit-based browsers for standard mobile web
            development using XPages. To find out more about Teamstudio
