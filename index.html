  <p>Our goal with this project is to create a highly-optimised set
    of XPages mobile controls with:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>close-to-native performance</li>
    <li>attractive aesthetics and</li>
    <li>compatible with the Teamstudio Unplugged mobile
      offline XPages engine running on iOS and Android devices.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible for (reasonably
    experienced) XPage developers to create attractive Unplugged mobile
    apps. Unplugged Controls can be styled to match a customer's
    preferred branding using the new Unplugged Re-Styler.
  </p>
  <p>We're also providing several app templates (Teamroom, Doc Library,
    Journal, Contacts, Activities, Media, Approvals) built from the
    controls to give you a faster start with your development projects.
    These controls target both tablet and smartphone users, for iOS
    (iOS 6.0 and higher) and Android devices (Android 4.0 and higher).
    We also publish periodic updates of to these controls to&nbsp;<a href="#">OpenNTF</a>.
  </p>
  <p>These controls are primarily designed to work with the Unplugged
    platform from Teamstudio. However they have been extended and
    tested to work on Webkit-based browsers for standard mobile web
    development using XPages. To find out more about Teamstudio
