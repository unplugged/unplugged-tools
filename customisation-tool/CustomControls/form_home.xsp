		<p>Our goal with this project is to create a highly-optimised set
			of XPages
			mobile controls with</p>
		<ol>
			<li>close-to-native performance</li>

			<li>attractive aesthetics and</li>

			<li>compatible with the Teamstudio Unplugged mobile offline
				XPages engine
				running on iOS and Android devices</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p>We wanted to make it as easy as possible for (reasonably
		experienced)
		XPage developers who donâ€™t have much or any mobile development
		experience to create attractive Unplugged mobile apps.</p>

	<p>Using these controls, we've also provided 3 application
		templates (Doc
		Library, Journal, Teamroom) that are compatible with the original Lotus
		Domino application templates. We are targeting both smartphone and
		tablet users, for iOS (iOS 5.01 and higher) and Android devices
		(Android 3.0 and higher).</p>

	<p>It is our intention to publish periodic updates to these controls
		to
		OpenNTF.</p>

	<p>
		<strong>**Update: All Doc is now on the Wiki at:</strong>
		<a href="https://github.com/unplugged/unplugged-controls/wiki">https://github.com/unplugged/unplugged-controls/wiki</a>
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
		When running the sample application on your server, open the
		'HomeLinks' view and ensure it is empty. Then open the 'Databases'
		view, select all documents and run the agent "Generate Home
		Workspace".
		This will create the documents required to populate the home page with
		icons.
	</p>

	<p>These controls are primarily designed to work with the
		Unplugged platform
		from Teamstudio. However they have been extended and tested to work on
		Web-kit based mobile browsers for standard Mobile Web Development in
		XPages. To find out more about Teamstudio Unplugged click here.</p>
